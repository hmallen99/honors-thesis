\section{Machine Learning Analysis}
\subsection{Machine Learning Methods}
Analysis was performed in Python using the Keras library from TensorFlow, decoding libraries
from MNE-Python, and the sklearn library. Data was split into training sets of 500 trials for
each subject with 100 trials of test trials. Trials were time-binned from 0-0.4 seconds at 0.025
second intervals to account for the 40hz MEG data. Models were trained for each subject to account
for individual Model accuracy was calculated with 5-fold cross-validation and evaluation accuracy
on the test dataset. Model accuracy was then compared with the results of a permutation test, in
which we shuffled around the training and test labels of the dataset to calculate a baseline accuracy
for a naive model. This test essentially compares our models to a chance accuracy.
